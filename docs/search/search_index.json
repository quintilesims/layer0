The example application in this section is a guestbook -- a web application that acts as a simple message board. You can choose to complete this section using either the Layer0 CLI or Terraform . Deploy with Layer0 CLI # If you're following along, you'll want to be working in the walkthrough/deployment-1/ directory of your clone of the guides repo. Files used in this deployment: Filename Purpose Guestbook.Dockerrun.aws.json Template for running the Guestbook application Part 1: Create the Environment # The first step in deploying an application with Layer0 is to create an environment. An environment is a dedicated space in which one or more services can reside. Here, we'll create a new environment named demo-env . At the command prompt, execute the following: l0 environment create demo-env We should see output like the following: ENVIRONMENT ID ENVIRONMENT NAME OS CLUSTER COUNT INSTANCE SIZE LINKS demoenvd4e17 demo-env linux 0 m3.medium We can inspect our environments in a couple of different ways: l0 environment list will give us a brief summary of all environments: ENVIRONMENT ID ENVIRONMENT NAME OS api api linux demoenvd4e17 demo-env linux l0 environment get demo-env will show us more information about the demo-env environment we just created: ENVIRONMENT ID ENVIRONMENT NAME OS CLUSTER COUNT INSTANCE SIZE LINKS demoenvd4e17 demo-env linux 0 m3.medium l0 environment get \\* illustrates wildcard matching (you could also have used demo* in the above command), and it will return detailed information for each environment, not just one - it's like a detailed list : ENVIRONMENT ID ENVIRONMENT NAME OS CLUSTER COUNT INSTANCE SIZE LINKS api api linux 2 t2.small demoenvd4e17 demo-env linux 0 m3.medium Part 2: Create the Load Balancer # In order to expose a web application to the public internet, we need to create a load balancer. A load balancer listens for web traffic at a specific address and directs that traffic to a Layer0 service. A load balancer also has a notion of a health check - a way to assess whether or not the service is healthy and running properly. By default, Layer0 configures the health check of a load balancer based upon a simple TCP ping to port 80 every thirty seconds. Also by default, this ping will timeout after five seconds of no response from the service, and two consecutive successes or failures are required for the service to be considered healthy or unhealthy. Here, we'll create a new load balancer named guestbook-lb inside of our environment named demo-env . The load balancer will listen on port 80, and forward that traffic along to port 80 in the Docker container using the HTTP protocol. Since the port configuration is already aligned with the default health check, we don't need to specify any health check configuration when we create this load balancer. At the command prompt, execute the following: l0 loadbalancer create --port 80:80/http demo-env guestbook-lb We should see output like the following: LOADBALANCER ID LOADBALANCER NAME ENVIRONMENT SERVICE PORTS PUBLIC URL IDLE TIMEOUT guestboc8d07 guestbook-lb demo-env 80:80/HTTP true 60 The following is a summary of the arguments passed in the above command: loadbalancer create : creates a new load balancer --port 80:80/HTTP : instructs the load balancer to forward requests from port 80 on the load balancer to port 80 in the EC2 instance using the HTTP protocol demo-env : the name of the environment in which you are creating the load balancer guestbook-lb : a name for the load balancer itself You can inspect load balancers in the same way that you inspected environments in Part 1. Try running the following commands to get an idea of the information available to you: l0 loadbalancer list l0 loadbalancer get guestbook-lb l0 loadbalancer get gues* l0 loadbalancer get \\* Note Notice that the load balancer list and get outputs list an ENVIRONMENT field - if you ever have load balancers (or other Layer0 entities) with the same name but in different environments, you can target a specific load balancer by qualifying it with its environment name: `l0 loadbalancer get demo-env:guestbook-lb` Part 3: Deploy the ECS Task Definition # The deploy command is used to specify the ECS task definition that outlines a web application. A deploy, once created, can be applied to multiple services - even across different environments! Here, we'll create a new deploy called guestbook-dpl that refers to the Guestbook.Dockerrun.aws.json file found in the guides reposiory. At the command prompt, execute the following: l0 deploy create Guestbook.Dockerrun.aws.json guestbook-dpl We should see output like the following: DEPLOY ID DEPLOY NAME VERSION guestbook-dpl.1 guestbook-dpl 1 The following is a summary of the arguments passed in the above command: deploy create : creates a new deployment and allows you to specify an ECS task definition Guestbook.Dockerrun.aws.json : the file name of the ECS task definition (use the full path of the file if it is not in your current working directory) guestbook-dpl : a name for the deploy, which you will use later when you create the service Deploy Versioning The DEPLOY NAME and VERSION are combined to create a unique identifier for a deploy. If you create additional deploys named guestbook-dpl , they will be assigned different version numbers. You can always specify the latest version when targeting a deploy by using deploy name :latest -- for example, guestbook-dpl:latest . Deploys support the same methods of inspection as environments and load balancers: l0 deploy list l0 deploy get guestbook* l0 deploy get guestbook:1 l0 deploy get guestbook:latest l0 deploy get \\* Part 4: Create the Service # The final stage of the deployment process involves using the service command to create a new service and associate it with the environment, load balancer, and deploy that we created in the previous sections. The service will execute the Docker containers which have been described in the deploy. Here, we'll create a new service called guestbook-svc . At the command prompt, execute the following: l0 service create --loadbalancer demo-env:guestbook-lb demo-env guestbook-svc guestbook-dpl:latest We should see output like the following: SERVICE ID SERVICE NAME ENVIRONMENT LOADBALANCER DEPLOYMENTS SCALE guestbo9364b guestbook-svc demo-env guestbook-lb guestbook-dpl:1* 0/1 The following is a summary of the arguments passed in the above command: service create : creates a new service --loadbalancer demo-env:guestbook-lb : the fully-qualified name of the load balancer; in this case, the load balancer named guestbook-lb in the environment named demo-env . - (It is not strictly necessary to use the fully qualified name of the load balancer, unless another load balancer with exactly the same name exists in a different environment.) demo-env : the name of the environment you created in Part 1 guestbook-svc : a name for the service you are creating guestbook-dpl : the name of the deploy that you created in Part 3 Layer0 services can be queried using the same get and list commands that we've come to expect by now. Check the Status of the Service # After a service has been created, it may take several minutes for that service to completely finish deploying. A service's status may be checked by using the service get command. Let's take a peek at our guestbook-svc service. At the command prompt, execute the following: l0 service get demo-env:guestbook-svc If we're quick enough, we'll be able to see the first stage of the process (this is what was output after running the service create command up in Part 4). We should see an asterisk (*) next to the name of the guestbook-dpl:1 deploy, which indicates that the service is in a transitional state: SERVICE ID SERVICE NAME ENVIRONMENT LOADBALANCER DEPLOYMENTS SCALE guestbo9364b guestbook-svc demo-env guestbook-lb guestbook-dpl:1* 0/1 In the next phase of deployment, if we execute the service get command again, we will see (1) in the Scale column; this indicates that 1 copy of the service is transitioning to an active state: SERVICE ID SERVICE NAME ENVIRONMENT LOADBALANCER DEPLOYMENTS SCALE guestbo9364b guestbook-svc demo-env guestbook-lb guestbook-dpl:1* 0/1 (1) In the final phase of deployment, we will see 1/1 in the Scale column; this indicates that the service is running 1 copy: SERVICE ID SERVICE NAME ENVIRONMENT LOADBALANCER DEPLOYMENTS SCALE guestbo9364b guestbook-svc demo-env guestbook-lb guestbook-dpl:1 1/1 Get the Application's URL # Once the service has been completely deployed, we can obtain the URL for the application and launch it in a browser.

The guestbook application will appear (once the service has completely finished deploying). Logs # Output from a Service's docker containers may be acquired by running the following command: l0 service logs SERVICE guestbook --------- 2018/11/05 19:11:46 Using memory backend 2018/11/05 19:11:46 Listening on :80 Cleanup CLI # If you're finished with the example and don't want to continue with this walkthrough, you can instruct Layer0 to delete the environment and terminate the application. l0 environment delete demo-env However, if you intend to continue through Deployment 2 , you will want to keep the resources you made in this section. Deploy with Terraform # Instead of using the Layer0 CLI directly, you can instead use our Terraform provider, and deploy using Terraform ( learn more ) . You can use Terraform with Layer0 and AWS to create \"fire-and-forget\" deployments for your applications. If you're following along, you'll want to be working in the walkthrough/deployment-1/ directory of your clone of the guides repo. We use these files to set up a Layer0 environment with Terraform: Filename Purpose main.tf Provisions resources; populates resources in template files outputs.tf Values that Terraform will yield during deployment terraform.tfstate Tracks status of deployment (created and managed by Terraform) terraform.tfvars Variables specific to the environment and application(s) variables.tf Values that Terraform will use during deployment *.tf : A Brief Aside # Let's take a moment to discuss the .tf files. The names of these files (and even the fact that they are separated out into multiple files at all) are completely arbitrary and exist soley for human-readability. Terraform understands all .tf files in a directory all together. In variables.tf , you'll see \"endpoint\" and \"token\" variables. In outputs.tf , you'll see that Terraform should spit out the url of the guestbook's load balancer once deployment has finished. In main.tf , you'll see the bulk of the deployment process. If you've followed along with the Layer0 CLI deployment above, it should be fairly easy to see how blocks in this file map to steps in the CLI process. When we began the CLI deployment, our first step was to create an environment: l0 environment create demo-env This command is recreated in main.tf like so: # walkthrough/deployment-1/main.tf resource layer0_environment demo-env { name = demo-env } We've bundled up the heart of the Guestbook deployment (load balancer, deploy, service, etc.) into a Terraform module . To use it, we declare a module block and pass in the source of the module as well as any configuration or variables that the module needs. # walkthrough/deployment-1/main.tf module guestbook { source = github.com/quintilesims/guides//guestbook/module environment_id = ${ layer0_environment . demo . id } } You can see that we pass in the ID of the environment we create. All variables declared in this block are passed to the module, so the next file we should look at is variables.tf inside of the module to get an idea of what the module is expecting. There are a lot of variables here, but only one of them doesn't have a default value. # guestbook/module/variables.tf variable environment_id { description = id of the layer0 environment in which to create resources } You'll notice that this is the variable that we're passing in. For this particular deployment of the Guestbook, all of the default options are fine. We could override any of them if we wanted to, just by specifying a new value for them back in deployment-1/main.tf . Now that we've seen the variables that the module will have, let's take a look at part of module/main.tf and see how some of them might be used: # guestbook/module/main.tf resource layer0_load_balancer guestbook-lb { name = ${ var . load_balancer_name } environment = ${ var . environment_id } port { host_port = 80 container_port = 80 protocol = http } } ... You can follow this link to learn more about Layer0 resources in Terraform. Part 1: Terraform Init # This deployment has provider dependencies so an init call must be made. (Terraform v0.11~ requries init) At the command prompt, execute the following command: terraform init We should see output like the following: Initializing modules... - module.guestbook Getting source github.com/quintilesims/guides//guestbook/module Initializing provider plugins... - Checking for available provider plugins on https://releases.hashicorp.com... - Downloading plugin for provider template (1.0.0)... The following providers do not have any version constraints in configuration, so the latest version was installed. To prevent automatic upgrades to new major versions that may contain breaking changes, it is recommended to add version = ... constraints to the corresponding provider blocks in configuration, with the constraint strings suggested below. * provider.template: version = ~ 1.0 Terraform has been successfully initialized! You may now begin working with Terraform. Try running terraform plan to see any changes that are required for your infrastructure. All Terraform commands should now work. If you ever set or change modules or backend configuration for Terraform, rerun this command to reinitialize your working directory. If you forget, other commands will detect it and remind you to do so if necessary. Part 2: Terraform Plan # Before we actually create/update/delete any resources, it's a good idea to find out what Terraform intends to do. Run terraform plan . Terraform will prompt you for configuration values that it does not have: var.endpoint Enter a value: var.token Enter a value: You can find these values by running l0-setup endpoint your layer0 prefix . Note There are a few ways to configure Terraform so that you don't have to keep entering these values every time you run a Terraform command (editing the terraform.tfvars file, or exporting environment variables like TF_VAR_endpoint and TF_VAR_token , for example). See the Terraform Docs for more. The plan command should give us output like the following: Refreshing Terraform state in-memory prior to plan... The refreshed state will be used to calculate this plan, but will not be persisted to local or remote state storage. data.template_file.guestbook: Refreshing state... ------------------------------------------------------------------------ An execution plan has been generated and is shown below.

This shows you that Terraform intends to create a deploy, an environment, a load balancer, and a service, all through Layer0. If you've gone through this deployment using the Layer0 CLI , you may notice that these resources appear out of order - that's fine. Terraform presents these resources in alphabetical order, but underneath, it knows the correct order in which to create them. Once we're satisfied that Terraform will do what we want it to do, we can move on to actually making these things exist! Part 3: Terraform Apply # Run terraform apply to begin the process. We should see output like the following: layer0_environment.demo: Refreshing state... ... ... ... layer0_service.guestbook: Creation complete Apply complete! Resources: 7 added, 0 changed, 0 destroyed. The state of your infrastructure has been saved to the path below. This state is required to modify and destroy your infrastructure, so keep it safe.

A load balancer listens for web traffic at a specific address and directs that traffic to a Layer0 service. A load balancer also has a notion of a health check - a way to assess whether or not the service is healthy and running properly. By default, Layer0 configures the health check of a load balancer based upon a simple TCP ping to port 80 every thirty seconds. Also by default, this ping will timeout after five seconds of no response from the service, and two consecutive successes or failures are required for the service to be considered healthy or unhealthy. Here, we'll create a new load balancer named guestbook-lb inside of our environment named demo-env . The load balancer will listen on port 80, and forward that traffic along to port 80 in the Docker container using the HTTP protocol.

In outputs.tf , you'll see that Terraform should spit out the url of the guestbook's load balancer once deployment has finished. In main.tf , you'll see the bulk of the deployment process. If you've followed along with the Layer0 CLI deployment above, it should be fairly easy to see how blocks in this file map to steps in the CLI process. When we began the CLI deployment, our first step was to create an environment: l0 environment create demo-env This command is recreated in main.tf like so: # walkthrough/deployment-1/main.tf resource layer0_environment demo-env { name = demo-env } We've bundled up the heart of the Guestbook deployment (load balancer, deploy, service, etc.) into a Terraform module . To use it, we declare a module block and pass in the source of the module as well as any configuration or variables that the module needs. # walkthrough/deployment-1/main.tf module guestbook { source = github.com/quintilesims/guides//guestbook/module environment_id = ${ layer0_environment . demo . id } } You can see that we pass in the ID of the environment we create. All variables declared in this block are passed to the module, so the next file we should look at is variables.tf inside of the module to get an idea of what the module is expecting. There are a lot of variables here, but only one of them doesn't have a default value. # guestbook/module/variables.tf variable environment_id { description = id of the layer0 environment in which to create resources } You'll notice that this is the variable that we're passing in. For this particular deployment of the Guestbook, all of the default options are fine. We could override any of them if we wanted to, just by specifying a new value for them back in deployment-1/main.tf . Now that we've seen the variables that the module will have, let's take a look at part of module/main.tf and see how some of them might be used: # guestbook/module/main.tf resource layer0_load_balancer guestbook-lb { name = ${ var . load_balancer_name } environment = ${ var . environment_id } port { host_port = 80 container_port = 80 protocol = http } } ...

Go ahead and add a few entries, make sure it's functioning properly. We'll wait. Now, let's prove that we've actually separated the data from the application by deleting and redeploying the Guestbook application: l0 service delete --wait guestbook-svc (We'll leave the deploy intact so we can spin up a new service easily, and we'll leave the environment untouched because it also contained the Redis server. We'll also pass the --wait flag so that we don't need to keep checking on the status of the job to know when it's complete.) Once those resources have been deleted, we can recreate them! Create another service, using the guestbook-dpl deploy we kept around: l0 service create --loadbalancer demo-env:guestbook-lb demo-env guestbook-svc guestbook-dpl:latest Wait for everything to spin up, and hit that new load balancer's url ( l0 loadbalancer get guestbook-lb ) with your browser.

This command is used with the following subcommands: create , delete , get , list , and setmincount . environment create # Use the create subcommand to create a new Layer0 environment. Usage # l0 environment create [--size size | --min-count mincount | --user-data path | --os os | --ami amiID] environmentName Required parameters # environmentName - A name for the environment. Optional arguments # --size size - The instance size of the EC2 instances to create in your environment (default: m3.medium). --min-count mincount - The minimum number of EC2 instances allowed in the environment's autoscaling group (default: 0). --user-data path - The user data template file to use for the environment's autoscaling group. --os os - The operating system used in the environment. Options are \"linux\" or \"windows\" (default: linux). More information on windows environments is documented below. ami amiID - A custom EC2 AMI ID to use in the environment. If not specified, Layer0 will use its default AMI ID for the specified operating system. The user data template can be used to add custom configuration to your Layer0 environment. They are usually scripts that are executed at instance launch time to ensure an EC2 instance is in the correct state after the provisioning process finishes. Layer0 uses Go Templates to render user data. Currently, two variables are passed into the template: ECSEnvironmentID and S3Bucket . Danger Please review the ECS Tutorial to better understand how to write a user data template, and use at your own risk!

Job # A Job is a long-running unit of work performed on behalf of the Layer0 API. Jobs are executed as Layer0 tasks that run in the api environment. The job command is used with the following subcommands: logs , delete , get , and list . job logs # Use the logs subcommand to display the logs from a Layer0 job that is currently running. Usage # l0 job logs [--start MM/DD HH:MM | --end MM/DD HH:MM | --tail=N] jobName Required parameters # jobName - The name of the Layer0 job for which you want to view logs.

The loadbalancer command is used with the following subcommands: create , delete , addport , dropport , get , list , healthcheck , and idletimeout . loadbalancer create # Use the create subcommand to create a new load balancer. Usage # l0 loadbalancer create [--port port ... | --certificate nameOrARN | --private | --healthcheck-target target | --healthcheck-interval interval | --healthcheck-timeout timeout | --healthcheck-healthy-threshold healthyThreshold | --healthcheck-unhealthy-threshold unhealthyThreshold | --idle-timeout idleTimeout] environmentName loadBalancerName Required parameters # environmentName - The name of the existing Layer0 environment in which you want to create the load balancer. loadBalancerName - A name for the load balancer you are creating. Optional arguments # --port port ... - The port configuration for the listener of the load balancer. Valid pattern is hostPort:containerPort/protocol . Multiple ports can be specified using --port port1 --port port2 ... (default: 80/80:TCP ). hostPort - The port that the load balancer will listen for traffic on. containerPort - The port that the load balancer will forward traffic to. protocol - The protocol to use when forwarding traffic (acceptable values: TCP, SSL, HTTP, and HTTPS). --certificate nameOrARN - The name or arn of an existing Layer0 certificate. You must include this option if you are using an HTTPS port configuration. --private - When you use this option, the load balancer will only be accessible from within the Layer0 environment. --healthcheck-target target - The target of the check. Valid pattern is PROTOCOL:PORT/PATH (default: \"TCP:80\" ). If PROTOCOL is HTTP or HTTPS , both PORT and PATH are required. Example: HTTP:80/admin/healthcheck . If PROTOCOL is TCP or SSL , PORT is required and PATH is not used. Example: TCP:80 --healthcheck-interval interval - The interval between checks (default: 30 ). --healthcheck-timeout timeout - The length of time before the check times out (default: 5 ). --healthcheck-healthy-threshold healthyThreshold - The number of checks before the instance is declared healthy (default: 2 ). --healthcheck-unhealthy-threshold unhealthyThreshold - The number of checks before the instance is declared unhealthy (default: 2 ). --idle-timeout idleTimeout - The idle timeout in seconds. Ports and Health Checks When both the --port and the --healthcheck-target options are omitted, Layer0 configures the load balancer with some default values: 80:80/TCP for ports and TCP:80 for healthcheck target. These default values together create a load balancer configured with a simple but functioning health check, opening up a set of ports that allows traffic to the target of the healthcheck. ( --healthcheck-target TCP:80 tells the load balancer to ping its services at port 80 to determine their status, and --port 80:80/TCP configures a security group to allow traffic to pass between port 80 of the load balancer and port 80 of its services) When creating a load balancer with non-default configurations for either --port or --healthcheck-target , make sure that a valid --port and --healthcheck-target pairing is also created. loadbalancer delete # Use the delete subcommand to delete an existing load balancer. Usage # l0 loadbalancer delete [--wait] loadBalancerName Required parameters # loadBalancerName - The name of the load balancer that you want to delete. Optional arguments # --wait - Wait until the deletion is complete before exiting. Additional information # In order to delete a load balancer that is already attached to a service, you must first delete the service that uses the load balancer.

When run without the --wait option, this operation will most likely exit before all of these tasks are complete; when run with the --wait option, this operation will only exit once these tasks have completed . loadbalancer addport # Use the addport subcommand to add a new port configuration to an existing Layer0 load balancer. Usage # l0 loadbalancer addport [--certificate certificateName] loadBalancerName port Required parameters # loadBalancerName - The name of an existing Layer0 load balancer in which you want to add the port configuration. port - The port configuration for the listener of the load balancer. Valid pattern is hostPort:containerPort/protocol . hostPort - The port that the load balancer will listen for traffic on. containerPort - The port that the load balancer will forward traffic to. protocol - The protocol to use when forwarding traffic (acceptable values: TCP, SSL, HTTP, and HTTPS). Optional arguments # --certificate certificateName - The name of an existing Layer0 certificate. You must include this option if you are using an HTTPS port configuration.

Additional information # Calling the subcommand without flags will display the current configuration of the load balancer's health check. Setting any of the flags will update the corresponding field in the health check, and all omitted flags will leave the corresponding fields unchanged. loadbalancer idletimeout # Use the idletimeout subcommand to update the idle timeout of a load balancer. The load balancer manages an idle timeout that is triggered when no data is sent over a connection for the specified time period. If no data has been sent or received by the time that the idle timeout period elapses, the load balancer closes the connection.

If you are new to Terraform, we recommend checking out their documentation . Layer0 has built a custom provider for Layer0. This provider allows users to create, manage, and update Layer0 entities using Terraform. Prerequisites # Terraform v0.11+ ( download ), accessible in your system path. Install # Download a Layer0 v0.8.4+ release . The Terraform plugin binary is located in the release zip file as terraform-provider-layer0 . Copy this terraform-provider-layer0 binary into the same directory as your Terraform binary - and you're done! For further information, see Terraform's documentation on installing a Terraform plugin here . Getting Started # Checkout the Terraform section of the Guestbook walkthrough here . We've added some tips and links to helpful resources in the Best Practices section below. Provider # The Layer0 provider is used to interact with a Layer0 API.

The first method is to update the existing Deploy to refer to a new Docker task definition. The second method is to create a new Service that uses the same Loadbalancer. The third method is to create both a new Loadbalancer and a new Service. There are advantages and disadvantages to each of these methods. The following sections discuss the advantages and disadvantages of using each method, and include procedures for implementing each method. Method 1: Refer to a new task definition # This method of updating a Layer0 application is the easiest to implement, because you do not need to rescale the Service or modify the Loadbalancer. This method is completely transparent to all other components of the application, and using this method does not involve any downtime. The disadvantage of using this method is that you cannot perform A/B testing of the old and new services, and you cannot control which traffic goes to the old service and which goes to the new one. To replace a Deploy to refer to a new task definition: At the command line, type the following to create a new Deploy: l0 deploy create taskDefPath deployName taskDefPath is the path to the ECS Task Definition. Note that if deployName already exists, this step will create a new version of that Deploy. Use l0 service update to update the existing service: l0 service update serviceName deployName[:deployVersion] By default, the service name you specify in this command will refer to the latest version of deployName . You can optionally specify a specific version of the deploy, as shown above. Method 2: Create a new Deploy and Service using the same Loadbalancer # This method of updating a Layer0 application is also rather easy to implement. Like the method described in the previous section, this method is completely transparent to all other services and components of the application. This method also you allows you to re-scale the service if necessary, using the l0 service scale command. Finally, this method allows for indirect A/B testing of the application; you can change the scale of the application, and observe the success and failure rates. The disadvantage of using this method is that you cannot control the routing of traffic between the old and new versions of the application. To create a new Deploy and Service: At the command line, type the following to create a new deploy or a new version of a deploy: l0 deploy create taskDefPath deployName taskDefPath is the path to the ECS Task Definition. Note that if deployName already exists, this step will create a new version of that Deploy. Use l0 service create to create a new service that uses deployName behind an existing load balancer named loadBalancerName l0 service create --loadbalancer [environmentName:]loadBalancerName environmentName serviceName deployName[:deployVersion] By default, the service name you specify in this command will refer to the latest version of deployName . You can optionally specify a specific version of the deploy, as shown above. You can also optionally specify the name of the environment, environmentName where the load balancer exists. Check to make sure that the new service is working as expected. If it is, and you do not want to keep the old service, delete the old service: l0 service delete service Method 3: Create a new Deploy, Loadbalancer and Service # The final method of updating a Layer0 service is to create an entirely new Deploy, Load Balancer and Service. This method gives you complete control over both the new and the old Service, and allows you to perform true A/B testing by routing traffic to individual Services. The disadvantage of using this method is that you need to implement a method of routing traffic between the new and the old Load Balancer. To create a new Deploy, Load Balancer and Service: Type the following command to create a new Deploy: l0 deploy create taskDefPath deployName taskDefPath is the path to the ECS Task Definition. Note that if deployName already exists, this step will create a new version of that Deploy. Use l0 loadbalancer create to create a new Load Balancer: l0 loadbalancer create --port port environmentName loadBalancerName deployName port is the port configuration for the listener of the Load Balancer. Valid pattern is hostPort:containerPort/protocol . Multiple ports can be specified using --port port1 --port port2 ... . hostPort - The port that the load balancer will listen for traffic on. containerPort - The port that the load balancer will forward traffic to. protocol - The protocol to use when forwarding traffic (acceptable values: TCP, SSL, HTTP, and HTTPS). Note The value of loadbalancerName in the above command must be unique to the Environment. Use l0 service create to create a new Service using the Load Balancer you just created: l0 service create --loadbalancer loadBalancerName environmentName serviceName deployName Note The value of serviceName in the above command must be unique to the Environment.

Make a note of the name that you selected when creating the key pair. Terraform v0.11+ We use Terraform to create the resources that Layer0 needs. If you're unfamiliar with Terraform, you may want to check out our introduction . If you're ready to install Terraform, there are instructions in the Terraform documentation . Part 1: Download and extract Layer0 # In the Downloads section of the home page , select the appropriate installation file for your operating system. Extract the zip file to a directory on your computer. (Optional) Place the l0 and l0-setup binaries into your system path. For more information about adding directories to your system path, see the following resources: (Windows): How to Edit Your System PATH for Easy Command Line Access in Windows (Linux/macOS): Adding a Directory to the Path Part 2: Create an Access Key # This step will create an Identity Access Management (IAM) access key for your AWS account. You will use the credentials created in this section when creating, updating, or removing Layer0 instances. To create an Access Key: In a web browser, login to the AWS Console . Click the Services dropdown menu in the upper left portion of the console page, then type IAM in the text box that appears at the top of the page after you click Services . As you type IAM, a search result will appear below the text box. Click on the IAM service result that appears below the text box. In the left panel, click Groups , and then confirm that you have a group called Administrators . Is the Administrators group missing in your AWS account? If the Administrators group does not already exist, complete the following steps: Click Create New Group . Name the new group Administrators , and then click Next Step . Check the AdministratorAccess policy to attach the Administrator policy to your new group. Click Next Step , and then click Create Group . In the left panel, click Users . Click the New User button and enter a unique user name you will use for Layer0. This user name can be used for multiple Layer0 installations. Check the box next to Programmatic access , and then click the Next: Permissions button. Make sure the Add user to group button is highlighted. Find and check the box next to the group Administrators . Click Next: Review button to continue. This will make your newly created user an administrator for your AWS account, so be sure to keep your security credentials safe! Review your choices and then click the Create user button. Once your user account has been created, click the Download .csv button to save your access and secret key to a CSV file. Part 3: Create a new Layer0 Instance # Now that you have downloaded Layer0 and configured your AWS account, you can create your Layer0 instance. From a command prompt, run the following (replacing instance_name with a name for your Layer0 instance): l0-setup init instance_name This command will prompt you for many different inputs.

Once the init command has successfully completed, you're ready to actually create the resources needed to use Layer0. Run the following command (again, replace instance_name with the name you've chosen for your Layer0 instance): l0-setup apply instance_name The first time you run the apply command, it may take around 5 minutes to complete. This command is idempotent; it is safe to run multiple times if it fails the first. At the end of the apply command, your Layer0 instance's configuration and state will be automatically backed up to an S3 bucket. You can manually back up your configuration at any time using the push command. It's a good idea to run this command regularly ( l0-setup push instance_name ) to ensure that your configuration is backed up. These files can be downloaded at any time using the pull command ( l0-setup pull instance_name ). Using a Private Docker Registry The procedures in this section are optional, but are highly recommended for production use. If you require authentication to a private Docker registry, you will need a Docker configuration file present on your machine with access to private repositories (typically located at ~/.docker/config.json ). If you don't have a config file yet, you can generate one by running docker login [registry-address] . A configuration file will be generated at ~/.docker/config.json . To add this authentication to your Layer0 instance, run: l0-setup init --docker-path= path/to/config.json instance_name This will reconfigure your Layer0 configuration and add a rendered file into your Layer0 instance's directory at ~/.layer0/ instance_name /dockercfg.json . You can modify a Layer0 instance's dockercfg.json file and re-run the apply command ( l0-setup apply instance_name ) to make changes to your authentication. Note: Any EC2 instances created prior to changing your dockercfg.json file will need to be manually terminated since they only grab the authentication file during instance creation. Terminated EC2 instances will be automatically re-created by autoscaling. Using an Existing VPC The procedures in this section must be followed precisely to properly install Layer0 into an existing VPC By default, l0-setup creates a new VPC to place resources. However, l0-setup can place resources in an existing VPC if the VPC meets all of the following conditions: Has access to the public internet (through a NAT instance or gateway) Has at least 1 public and 1 private subnet The public and private subnets have the tag Tier: Public or Tier: Private , respectively. For information on how to tag AWS resources, please visit the AWS documentation . Once you are sure the existing VPC satisfies these requirements, run the init command, placing the VPC ID when prompted: l0-setup init instance_name ... VPC ID (optional): The vpc_id input variable specifies an existing AWS VPC to provision the AWS resources required for Layer0. If no input is specified, a new VPC will be created for you. Existing VPCs must satisfy the following constraints: - Have access to the public internet (through a NAT instance or gateway) - Have at least 1 public and 1 private subnet - Each subnet must be tagged with [ Tier : Private ] or [ Tier : Public ] Note that changing this value will destroy and recreate any existing resources. [current: ] Please enter a new value, or press enter to keep the current value. Input: vpc123 Once the command has completed, it is safe to run apply to provision the resources.

If your Service is behind a private load balancer, or none at all, you can either re-create your Service behind a public load balancer, use an existing public load balancer as a \"jump\" point, or create a new Layer0 Service behind a public load balancer to serve as a \"jump\" point.","title":"Secure Shell (SSH)"},{"location":"troubleshooting/ssh/#secure-shell-ssh","text":"You can use Secure Shell (SSH) to access your Layer0 environment(s). By default, Layer0 Setup asks for an EC2 key pair when creating a new Layer0. This key pair is associated with all machines that host your Layer0 Services. This means you can use SSH to log into the underlying Docker host to perform tasks such as troubleshooting failing containers or viewing logs.
