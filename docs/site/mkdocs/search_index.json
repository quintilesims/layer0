In your email, include your team name and the name of the team owner.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA d.ims.io token.\n\n\nThis token grants you read access to the IMS private Docker Registry. You can use the same token for multiple Layer0 installations.\nTo generate a token, go to \nhttps://d.ims.io/token\n. Log in using your IMS Health domain credentials.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAn EC2 Key Pair.\n This allows SSH access into the EC2 instances running your Services. \nYou can use an existing key pair if you've already made one.\nOtherwise, create an EC2 key pair in AWS following their \ninstructions\n.\nChoose any name for the key pair and make note of it. \n\n\n\n\n\n\nPart 1: Download and extract Layer0\n#\n\n\n\n\nIn the \nDownloads section of the home page\n, select the appropriate installation file for your operating system. Extract the zip file to a directory on your computer.\n\n\nAdd both the directory that contains the \nl0\n application, as well as the entire l0-setup directory, to your system path. The l0-setup directory contains files that are necessary for the \nl0-setup\n application to work properly, so you must add the entire directory to your path. \nFor more information about adding directories to your system path, see the following resources:\n\n\n(Windows) \nHow to Edit Your System PATH for Easy Command Line Access in Windows\n\n\n(Linux/Mac) \nAdding a Directory to the Path\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPart 2: Create an Access Key\n#\n\n\nThis step will create an Identity \n Access Management (IAM) access key from your BYOO instance. You will use the credentials created in this section when installing, updating, or removing Layer0 resources. \n\n\nTo create an Access Key:\n\n\n\n\nIn a web browser, go to your team's BYOO login page. Log in using your IMS Health domain credentials. \n\n\nUnder \nSecurity and Identity\n, click \nIdentity and Access Management\n.\n\n\nClick \nGroups\n.\n\n\nClick \nCreate New Group\n and enter the name: \nAdministrators\n. Click \nNext Step\n.\n\n\nClick on \nAdministratorAccess\n to attach the Administator policy to your new group. Click \nNext Step\n to review and \nCreate Group\n to create your group.\n\n\nAfter creating your group, click on \nUsers\n.\n\n\nClick \nCreate New Users\n and enter a unique user name you will use for Layer0. This user name can be used for multiple Layer0 installations. Ensure the box \nGenerate an Access Key for each user\n is checked, and click \nCreate\n.\n\n\nAfter your user is created successfully, you'll be presented with new user security credentials. Click \nDownload Credentials\n, which will save your new access key to a CSV file.

If the \napply\n command fails to complete successfully, it is safe to run it again until it succeeds.\n\n\nPart 4: Configure environment variables\n#\n\n\nOnce the \napply\n command has run successfully, you can configure the Layer0 environment variables using the \nendpoint\n command.\n\n\nTo view the environment variables for your Layer0, type the following command, replacing \nprefix\n with the Layer0 prefix you created in Part 2: \n\n\n  \nl0-setup endpoint --insecure\n \nprefix\n\n\n\n\nAlternatively, you can view the environment variables and apply them to your shell using a single command:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(Windows PowerShell): \nl0-setup endpoint --insecure --powershell\n \nprefix\n \n| Out-String | Invoke-Expression\n\n\n(Linux/Mac): \neval \"$(l0-setup endpoint --insecure\n \nprefix\n)\"\n\n\n\n\nPart 5: Configure DNS Endpoint\n#\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\nThe procedures in this section are optional, but are highly recommended for production use.\n\n\n\n\nLayer0 is configured to use SSL with the imshealthlabs.net domain. Follow the procedures in this section to associate a subdomain of imshealthlabs.net with your Layer0 endpoint.\n\n\nTo associate a subdomain with your Layer0 endpoint:\n\n\n\n\nContact the \nDevOps team\n and request a user account on the DevOps AWS account.\n\n\nOnce you have received the DevOps AWS account credentials, sign in to the \nAWS Console\n.\n\n\nUnder \nNetworking\n, click \nRoute 53\n.\n\n\nIn the menu on the left side of the screen, click \nHosted zones\n.\n\n\nIn the list of domains, click \nimshealthlabs.net\n.\n\n\nClick \nCreate Record Set\n.\n\n\nIn the \nCreate Record Set\n panel on the right side of the screen, configure the record set:\n\n\nIn the \nName\n field, type the subdomain. The subdomain name you specify must be unique.\n\n\nFrom the \nType\n menu, select \nCNAME - Canonical name\n.\n\n\nIn the \nValue\n field, enter the endpoint URL for your Layer0.

Before continuing, determine which of the following sections applies to your current Layer0 installation:\n\n\n\n\nUpgrading from version 0.5.5 or earlier to the latest version of Layer0\n\n\nUpgrading from version 0.6.0 or 0.6.1 to the latest version of Layer0 0.6.2\n\n\nUpgrading ffrom version 0.7.x to 0.7.2\n\n\nUpgrading versions not listed above\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUpgrading from version 0.5.5 or earlier to the latest version of Layer0\n#\n\n\nThe architecture of Layer0 version 0.5.5 and earlier is not compatible with the architecture of more recent versions. For this reason, Layer0 versions 0.5.5 and earlier cannot be upgraded.\n\n\nIf you are using Layer0 0.5.5 or earlier and want to upgrade to a more recent version, we recommend that you create a new Layer0 using the current version of Layer0, and then migrate your services onto it by deploying your Docker task definitions into the new instance.\n\n\nIf you have questions about migrating from an older version of Layer0, visit the \n#xfra Slack channel\n.\n\n\n\n\nUpgrading from version 0.6.0 or 0.6.1 to the latest version of Layer0\n#\n\n\nIn order to upgrade from version 0.6.0 or 0.6.1 to the current version of Layer0, you must first complete some steps that are specific to these versions of Layer0.\n\n\nThis upgrade will move your Layer0 API server from Elastic Beanstalk to the EC2 Container Server (ECS), which will change the URL of your Layer0 API endpoint.

The sample application in this guide is a guestbook\na web application that acts as a simple message board.\n\n\nBefore you start\n#\n\n\nIn order to complete the procedures in this section, you must install and configure Layer0 v0.7.2 or later. If you have not already configured Layer0, see the \ninstallation guide\n. If you are running an older version of Layer0, see the \nupgrade instructions\n.\n\n\nOnce Layer0 is configured on your computer, download the \nGuestbook Task Definition\n; save the resulting file as \"Guestbook.Dockerrun.aws.json\". The instructions in this section assume that this file is located in the directory in which Layer0 is installed; if you place the file elsewhere, you will need to provide the complete path to the file when you reference it in \nPart 4\n.\n\n\n\n\nPart 1: Create the environment\n#\n\n\nThe first step in deploying an application in Layer0 is to create an environment.\nAn environment is a dedicated space in which one or more services can reside. In this example, you will create an environment named \"demo\".\n\n\nTo create the environment\n\n\n\n  \nAt the command prompt, run the following command to create a new environment named \ndemo\n:\n    \n\n      \nl0 environment create demo\n\n    \n\n  \nYou will see the following output:\n\nENVIRONMENT ID  ENVIRONMENT NAME  SERVICE ID\n1demo           demo\n\n  \n\n\n\n\nPart 2: Create the load balancer\n#\n\n\nIn order to expose a web application to the public internet, you must create a load balancer. A load balancer listens for web traffic at a specific address, and directs that traffic to a Layer0 service.\n\n\nBy default, Layer0 load balancers listen for web traffic on port 80 and forward it on port 80 using the TCP protocol. You can modify the way in which ports are forwarded, as well as the protocol used, using the \n--port\n option.\n\n\nIn this example, you will create a new load balancer called \"guestbooklb\" in the environment named \"demo\". The load balancer will listen on port 80, and forward traffic to port 80 in the Docker container using the HTTP protocol.\n\n\nTo create the load balancer:\n\n\n\n  \nAt the command prompt, run the following command to create a load balancer named \nguestbooklb\n that forwards traffic on port 80 using the HTTP protocol:\n    \n\n      \nl0 loadbalancer create --port 80:80/http demo guestbooklb\n\n    \n\n  \nYou will see the following output:\n\nLOADBALANCER ID  LOADBALANCER NAME  ENVIRONMENT  SERVICES  PORTS       PUBLIC  URL\n1guestbooklb     guestbooklb        demo                   80:80/http  true\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe following is an summary of the arguments passed in the above command:\n\n\n\n\nloadbalancer create\n: creates a new load balancer\n\n\n--port 80:80/http\n: instructs the load balancer to forward requests from port 80 on the server to port 80 in the Docker container using the HTTP protocol\n\n\ndemo\n: the name of the environment in which you are creating the load balancer\n\n\nguestbooklb\n: a name for the load balancer itself\n\n\n\n\nPart 3: Deploy the Docker task definition\n#\n\n\nThe \ndeploy\n command is used to specify the Docker task definition that refers to a web application. In this section, you will create a new deploy called \"guestbook\" that refers to the Guestbook.Dockerrun.aws.json file you created earlier.\n\n\nTo deploy the Guestbook task definition:\n\n\n\n  \nAt the command prompt, run the following command:\n    \n\n      \nl0 deploy create Guestbook.Dockerrun.aws.json guestbook\n\n    \n\n  \nYou will see the following output:\n\nDEPLOY ID       DEPLOY NAME  VERSION\n1guestbook:1    guestbook    1\n\n  \n\n\n\n\nThe following is an summary of the arguments passed in the above command:\n\n\n\n\ndeploy create\n: creates a new deployment and allows you to specify a Docker task definition\n\n\nGuestbook.Dockerrun.aws.json\n: the file name of the Docker task definition (use the full path of the file if it is not in the same directory as l0-setup)\n\n\nguestbook\n: a name for the deploy, which you will use later when you create the service\n\n\n\n\nThe Deploy Name and Version are combined to create a unique identifier for a deploy.\nIf you create additional deploys named \"guestbook,\"  they will be assigned different version numbers.\n\n\nPart 4: Create the service\n#\n\n\nThe final part of the deployment process involves using the \nservice create\n command to create a new service and associate it with the environment, load balancer and deployment you created in the previous sections. The service will execute the containers described in the deployment. In this example, you will create a new service called \"guestbooksrv\".\n\n\nTo create the service:\n\n\n\n  \nAt the command prompt, run the following command:\n    \n\n      \nl0 service create --loadbalancer demo:guestbooklb demo guestbooksvc guestbook:latest\n\n    \n\n  \nYou will see the following output:\n\nSERVICE ID      SERVICE NAME  ENVIRONMENT  LOADBALANCER  DEPLOYS      SCALE\n1guestbooksvc   guestbooksvc  demo         guestbooklb   guestbook:1  0/1\n\n  \n\n\n\n\nThe following is an summary of the arguments passed in the above command:\n\n\n\n\nservice create\n: creates a new service\n\n\n--loadbalancer demo:guestbooklb\n: the fully-qualified name of the load balancer; in this case, the load balancer named \"guestbooklb\" in the environment named \"demo.\" It is not strictly necessary to use the fully qualified name of the load balancer, unless another load balancer with exactly the same name exists in a different environment.\n\n\ndemo\n: the name of the environment you created in \nPart 1\n\n\nguestbooksvc\n: a name for the service you are creating\n\n\nguestbook\n: the name of the deploy that you created in \nPart 3\n\n\n\n\nPart 5: Test the application\n#\n\n\nCheck the status of the service\n#\n\n\nAfter you create a service, it may take several minutes for that service to completely finish deploying. You can check the status of a service using the \nservice get\n command.\n\n\nTo check the status:\n\n\n\n  \nAt the command prompt, type the following command to check the status of the \"guestbooksvc\" deploy:\n    \n\n      \nl0 service get demo:guestbooksvc\n\n    \n\n\n\n\nInitially, you will see an asterisk (*) next to the name of the \"guestbook:1\" deploy; this indicates that the service is in a transitional state.

These steps describe the process of creating a new RDS instance for this purpose.\n\n\nTo create a new RDS database:\n\n\n\n\nDownload the \nRDS Cloudformation script\n and save it to your computer.\n\n\nGo to \nthe AWS Console page for Layer0\n. Log in using your IMS Health domain credentials.\n\n\nUnder \nManagement Tools\n, click \nCloudFormation\n.\n\n\nClick \nCreate Stack\n.\n\n\nNext to \nChoose a Template\n, select \nUpload a template to Amazon S3\n. Click the \nBrowse\n button. On the file selection window, select the file that you downloaded in step 1 (\ncloudformation.json\n), and then click \nNext\n.\n\n\nUnder \nParameters\n, enter the following details:\n\n\nStack Name\n: \nLayer0Prefix\n-guestbook-rds\n\n\nDatabase\n: \nguestbook\n\n\nEnvironmentSG\n: Select the item that starts with \nLayer0Prefix\n-demo\n\n\nPassword\n: a password that you specify.

Click \nCreate\n. The process of creating the stack requires about 10 minutes to complete; wait until this process is complete before proceeding to the next section.\n\n\n\n\nPart 2: Create a deploy\n#\n\n\nAfter the RDS database is ready, you can create a new deploy for the service.\n\n\nTo create a new deploy:\n\n\n\n\nDownload the \nRDS Guestbook Task Definition\n and save it to your computer as \nGuestbookRDS.Dockerrun.aws.json\n.\n\n\nIn the AWS Console, under \nManagement Tools\n, click \nCloudFormation\n, and then click the name of the stack you created in the previous section. Click \nOutputs\n to see a list of the variables you specified in the previous section.\n\n\nIn a text editor, open the GuestbookRDS.Dockerrun.aws.json file. This file uses environment variables for configuration. Edit the file to use the appropriate values for your stack. When you are finished, the \nenvironment\n section should resemble the following example:\n\n\n...\n\"environment\": [\n    {\n        \"name\": \"GB_DB_NAME\",\n        \"value\": \"guestbook\"\n    },\n    {\n        \"name\": \"GB_DB_HOST\",\n        \"value\": \"guestbook.abc123.us-west-2.rds.amazonaws.com\"\n    },\n    {\n        \"name\": \"GB_DB_PORT\",\n        \"value\": \"3306\"\n    },\n    {\n        \"name\": \"GB_DB_USER\",\n        \"value\": \"admin\"\n    },\n    {\n        \"name\": \"GB_DB_PASSWORD\",\n        \"value\": \"password\"\n    }\n]\n...\n\n\n\nSave the changes you made to \nGuestbookRDS.Dockerrun.aws.json\n.\n\n\nAt the command prompt, run the following command:\n\n\n\n\nl0 deploy create GuestbookRDS.Dockerrun.aws.json guestbook\n\n\nYou will see the following output:\n\n\nDEPLOY ID       DEPLOY NAME  VERSION\n1guestbook:2    guestbook    2\n\n\n\n\n\nThe number 2 in the \nVersion\n column indicates that this is the second iteration of this deploy (the deploy from the previous guestbook example was the first iteration).\n\n\nPart 3: Apply the deploy\n#\n\n\nAt this point, you can use the \ndeploy\n command to deploy the latest version of the deploy named \"guestbook\" to our existing service (\"guestbooksvc\"). Using this command will instruct the service to run the new version of the Guestbook container, along with the environment variables you specified in the task definition in the previous section.\n\n\nTo apply the deploy, run the following command:\n\n\nl0 deploy apply guestbook:2 demo:guestbooksvc\n\n\nYou will see the following output:\n\n\nSuccessfully Applied Deploy\n\n\n\n\n\nPart 4: Test the application\n#\n\n\nCheck the status of the service\n#\n\n\nAfter you create a service, it may take several minutes for that service to completely finish deploying. You can check the status of a service using the \nservice get\n command.\n\n\nTo check the status of the guestbook service, run the following command:\n\n\n  \nl0 service get demo:guestbooksvc\n\n\n\nInitially, you will see an asterisk (*) next to the name of the \"guestbook:1\" deploy; this indicates that the service is in a transitional state. In this phase, if you execute the \nservice get\n command again, you will see the following output:\n\n\nSERVICE ID      SERVICE NAME  ENVIRONMENT  LOADBALANCER     DEPLOYS       SCALE\n1guestbooksvc   guestbook     demo         guestbooklb      guestbook:2*  1/1\n                                                            guestbook:1\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the next phase of the deployment, you will see \"(1)\" in the Scale column; this indicates that 1 copy of the service is transitioning to an active state. In this phase, if you execute the \nservice get\n command again, you will see the following output:\n\n\nSERVICE ID      SERVICE NAME  ENVIRONMENT  LOADBALANCER     DEPLOYS       SCALE\n1guestbooksvc   guestbook     demo         guestbooklb      guestbook:2*  1/1 (1)\n                                                            guestbook:1\n\n\n\n\n\nThe system will wait until the guestbook:2 deploy is running before it stops the currently-running guestbook:1 deploy. In this phase, if you execute the \nservice get\n command again, you will see the following output:\n\n\nSERVICE ID      SERVICE NAME  ENVIRONMENT  LOADBALANCER     DEPLOYS       SCALE\n1guestbooksvc   guestbook     demo         guestbooklb      guestbook:2   2/1\n                                                            guestbook:1\n\n\n\n\n\nOnce the guestbook:2 deploy is running, the guestbook:1 deploy will be stopped.\nThe Deploys and Scale columns will indicate that only one deploy (the guestbook:2 deploy) is running.
