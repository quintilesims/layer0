            "text": "Install and Configure Layer0\n#\n\n\nPrerequisites\n#\n\n\nBefore you can install and configure Layer0, you must obtain the following:\n\n\n\n\nAn AWS account.\n\n\nAn EC2 Key Pair.\n This key pair allows you to access the EC2 instances running your Services using SSH. If you have already created a key pair, you can use it for this process. Otherwise, follow the \ninstructions at aws.amazon.com\n to create a new key pair. Make a note of the name that you selected when creating the key pair.\n\n\n\n\nPart 1: Download and extract Layer0\n#\n\n\n\n\nIn the \nDownloads section of the home page\n, select the appropriate installation file for your operating system. Extract the zip file to a directory on your computer.\n\n\nAdd both the directory that contains the \nl0\n application, as well as the entire l0-setup directory, to your system path. The l0-setup directory contains files that are necessary for the \nl0-setup\n application to work properly, so you must add the entire directory to your path.\nFor more information about adding directories to your system path, see the following resources:\n\n\n(Windows): \nHow to Edit Your System PATH for Easy Command Line Access in Windows\n\n\n(Linux/macOS): \nAdding a Directory to the Path\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPart 2: Create an Access Key\n#\n\n\nThis step will create an Identity \n Access Management (IAM) access key from your AWS account. You will use the credentials created in this section when installing, updating, or removing Layer0 resources.\n\n\nTo create an Access Key:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn a web browser, login to the \nAWS Console\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUnder \nSecurity and Identity\n, click \nIdentity and Access Management\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClick \nGroups\n, and then click \nAdministrators\n. \nNote\nIf the \nAdministrators\n group does not already exist, complete the following steps: \nClick \nCreate New Group\n. Name the new group \"Administrators\", and then click \nNext Step\n.\nClick \nAdministratorAccess\n to attach the Administrator policy to your new group.\nClick \nNext Step\n, and then click \nCreate Group\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClick \nUsers\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClick \nCreate New Users\n and enter a unique user name you will use for Layer0. This user name can be used for multiple Layer0 installations. Check the box next to \nGenerate an Access Key for each user\n, and then click \nCreate\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOnce your user account has been created, click \nDownload Credentials\n to save your access key to a CSV file.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the Users list, click the user account you just created. Under \nUser Actions\n, click \nAdd User to Groups\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSelect the group \nAdministrators\n and click \nAdd to Groups\n. This will make your newly created user an administrator for your AWS account, so be sure to keep your security credentials safe!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(Optional) Part 3: Configure the dockercfg file to use a private Docker registry\n#\n\n\n\n\nNote\nThe procedures in this section are optional, but are highly recommended for production use.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBefore you create your Layer0, if you require private registry authentication, you need to create a file named \ndockercfg\n your layer0 instance directory, located at \n~/layer0/instances/\nprefix\n/dockercfg\n.\nIf you do not add this file prior to running \nl0-setup apply\n, you will be prompted to continue.\n\n\nTo add private registry authentication, add the file \n~/layer0/instances/\nprefix\n/dockercfg\n with the authentication information for your private registry.\nThe format should be similar to:\n\n{\n  \"https://index.docker.io/v1/\": {\n    \"username\": \"my_name\",\n    \"password\": \"my_password\",\n    \"email\": \"email@example.com\"\n  }\n}\n\n\nAfter you run the \nl0-setup apply\n command on your Layer0, the \ndockercfg\n file (along with other configuration files) for your layer0 will be stored in \n~/layer0/instances/\nprefix\n/\n.\nYou can modify this file and re-run \nl0-setup apply\n to make changes to your authentication. \nNote that any EC2 instances created prior to changing your \ndockercfg\n file will need to be manually terminated since they only grab the \ndockercfg\n authentication file once during instance creation. \nTerminated EC2 instances will be automatically re-created by autoscaling. \n\n\nPart 4: Configure your Layer0\n#\n\n\nNow that you have downloaded Layer0 and configured your AWS instance, you can create your Layer0.\n\n\nTo configure Layer0:\n\n\n\n\nAt the command prompt, navigate to the \nl0-setup\n subdirectory in the folder in which you extracted the Layer0 files.\n\n\nType the following command, replacing \n[prefix]\n with a unique name for your Layer0: \nl0-setup apply [prefix]\n\n\nWhen prompted, enter the following information:\n\n\nAWS Access Key ID\n: The access key ID contained in the credential file that you downloaded in step 6 of the previous section.\n\n\nAWS Secret Access Key\n: The secret access key contained in the credential file that you downloaded in step 6 of the previous section.\n\n\nKey Pair\n: The name of the key pair that you created in the Prerequisites section.\nThe first time you run the \napply\n command, it may take around 15 minutes to complete. If the \napply\n command fails to complete successfully, it is safe to run it again until it succeeds.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPart 5: Configure the environment variables\n#\n\n\nOnce the \napply\n command has run successfully, you can configure the Layer0 environment variables using the \nendpoint\n command.\n\n\nTo view the environment variables for your Layer0 and apply them to your shell, type the following command, replacing \n[prefix]\n with the name of the Layer0 prefix you created in Part 3:\n\n\n\n\n(Windows PowerShell): \nl0-setup endpoint --insecure --synax=powershell [prefix] | Out-String | Invoke-Expression\n\n\n(Linux/macOS): \neval \"$(l0-setup endpoint --insecure [prefix])\"\n\n\n\n\n(Optional) Part 6: Using a custom certificate\n#\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\nThe procedures in this section are optional, but are highly recommended for production use.\n\n\n\n\nLayer0 uses a self-signed certificate to run the API. \nIn a production setting, we recommend using a certificate from a trusted CA.\n\n\nTo use a custom certificate:\n\n\n\n    \nIn a text editor, open the file in your Layer0 directory named elb.tf.template. \nThe full path will be `~/layer0/instances/\n/elb.tf.template`.\nUpdate the following line the file:\n\n\n...\n    ssl_certificate_id = \"[ARN of your SSL cert]\"\n...\n\n\n    \nSave the modified elb.tf.template file, and then run the following command: \nl0-setup apply [prefix]",

Before continuing, determine which of the following sections applies to your current Layer0 installation:\n\n\n\n\nUpgrading to version 0.8.4\n\n\nUpgrading from version 0.5.5 or earlier to the latest version of Layer0\n\n\nUpgrading from version 0.6.0 or 0.6.1 to the latest version of Layer0 0.6.2\n\n\nUpgrading from version 0.7.x to 0.7.2\n\n\nUpgrading versions not listed above\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUpgrading to version 0.8.4\n#\n\n\nLayer0 Setup v0.8.4 contains changes to better support open source Layer0 installations.\nThe major changes are:  \n\n\n\n\nReplacing the \nimshealthlabs\n certificate with a self signed certificate\n\n\nRemoving the \ndocker_token\n variable for \nd.ims.io\n, and using a \ndockercfg\n file to track private registry authentication\n\n\n\n\nAs a result of these changes, terraform will fail to run against l0-setup files created prior to v0.8.4. \nPlease create your v0.8.4 instances from scratch.\nBe sure to follow our updated \ninstallation\n docs.\n\n\n===\n\n\nUpgrading from version 0.5.5 or earlier to the latest version of Layer0\n#\n\n\nThe architecture of Layer0 version 0.5.5 and earlier is not compatible with the architecture of more recent versions. For this reason, Layer0 versions 0.5.5 and earlier cannot be upgraded.\n\n\nIf you are using Layer0 0.5.5 or earlier and want to upgrade to a more recent version, we recommend that you create a new Layer0 using the current version of Layer0, and then migrate your services onto it by deploying your Docker task definitions into the new instance.\n\n\nIf you have questions about migrating from an older version of Layer0, email the development team at \nxfra@us.imshealth.com\n.\n\n\n\n\nUpgrading from version 0.6.0 or 0.6.1 to the latest version of Layer0\n#\n\n\nIn order to upgrade from version 0.6.0 or 0.6.1 to the current version of Layer0, you must first complete some steps that are specific to these versions of Layer0.\n\n\nThis upgrade will move your Layer0 API server from Elastic Beanstalk to the EC2 Container Server (ECS), which will change the URL of your Layer0 API endpoint.

Terraform will prompt you for configuration values that it does not have.\n\n\nTo begin deploying the application, run the following command:\n\n\n  \nterraform apply\n\n\n\n\nTo avoid entering these values manually each time you run terraform, you can set the terraform variables by editing the \nterraform.tfvars\n file.\n\n\nvar.endpoint\n  Enter a value: \nenter your Layer0 endpoint\n\n\nvar.token\n  Enter a value: \nenter your Layer0 token\n\n\nlayer0_environment.demo: Refreshing state...\n...\n...\n...\nlayer0_service.guestbook: Creation complete\n\nApply complete!

During that time you may get HTTP 503 errors when making HTTP requests against the load balancer URL.\n\n\nTerraform will set up the entire environment for you and then output a link to the application's load balancer.\n\n\nWhat's happening\n#\n\n\nTerraform provisions the AWS resources (an RDS instance, VPC and subnet configurations to connect the RDS instance to the Layer0 application), configures environment variables for the application, and deploys the application into a Layer0 environment.\n\n\nYou can use Terraform with Layer0 and AWS to create fire and forget deployments for your applications.\n\n\nWe use these files to set up a Layer0 envrionment with Terraform\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFilename\n\n\nPurpose\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nterraform.tfvars\n\n\nVariables specific to the environment and guestbook application\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDockerrun.aws.json\n\n\nTemplate for running the guestbook application in a Layer0 environment\n\n\n\n\n\n\nlayer0.tf\n\n\nProvision Layer0 resources\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTerraform figures out the appropriate order for creating each resource and handles the entire provisioning process.\n\n\nCleanup\n#\n\n\nWhen you're finished with the example run \nterraform destroy\n in the same directory to destroy the Layer0 environment and application.\n\n\n\n\nDeploy with Layer0 CLI\n#\n\n\nYou can also use the Layer0 CLI to provision each piece of this simple application.\n\n\nPart 1: Create the environment\n#\n\n\nThe first step in deploying an application in Layer0 is to create an environment.\nAn environment is a dedicated space in which one or more services can reside. In this example, you will create an environment named \"demo\".\n\n\nTo create the environment\n\n\n\n  \nAt the command prompt, run the following command to create a new environment named \ndemo\n:\n    \n\n      \nl0 environment create demo\n\n    \n\n  \nYou will see the following output:\n\nENVIRONMENT ID  ENVIRONMENT NAME  SERVICE ID\n1demo           demo\n\n  \n\n\n\n\nPart 2: Create the load balancer\n#\n\n\nIn order to expose a web application to the public internet, you must create a load balancer. A load balancer listens for web traffic at a specific address, and directs that traffic to a Layer0 service.\n\n\nBy default, Layer0 load balancers listen for web traffic on port 80 and forward it on port 80 using the TCP protocol. You can modify the way in which ports are forwarded, as well as the protocol used, using the \n--port\n option.\n\n\nIn this example, you will create a new load balancer called \"guestbooklb\" in the environment named \"demo\". The load balancer will listen on port 80, and forward traffic to port 80 in the Docker container using the HTTP protocol.\n\n\nTo create the load balancer:\n\n\n\n  \nAt the command prompt, run the following command to create a load balancer named \nguestbooklb\n that forwards traffic on port 80 using the HTTP protocol:\n    \n\n      \nl0 loadbalancer create --port 80:80/http demo guestbooklb\n\n    \n\n  \nYou will see the following output:\n\nLOADBALANCER ID  LOADBALANCER NAME  ENVIRONMENT  SERVICES  PORTS       PUBLIC  URL\n1guestbooklb     guestbooklb        demo                   80:80/http  true\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe following is an summary of the arguments passed in the above command:\n\n\n\n\nloadbalancer create\n: creates a new load balancer\n\n\n--port 80:80/http\n: instructs the load balancer to forward requests from port 80 on the server to port 80 in the Docker container using the HTTP protocol\n\n\ndemo\n: the name of the environment in which you are creating the load balancer\n\n\nguestbooklb\n: a name for the load balancer itself\n\n\n\n\nPart 3: Deploy the Docker task definition\n#\n\n\nThe \ndeploy\n command is used to specify the Docker task definition that refers to a web application. In this section, you will create a new deploy called \"guestbook\" that refers to the Guestbook.Dockerrun.aws.json file you created earlier.\n\n\nTo deploy the Guestbook task definition:\n\n\n\n  \nAt the command prompt, run the following command:\n    \n\n      \nl0 deploy create Guestbook.Dockerrun.aws.json guestbook\n\n    \n\n  \nYou will see the following output:\n\nDEPLOY ID       DEPLOY NAME  VERSION\n1guestbook:1    guestbook    1\n\n  \n\n\n\n\nThe following is an summary of the arguments passed in the above command:\n\n\n\n\ndeploy create\n: creates a new deployment and allows you to specify a Docker task definition\n\n\nGuestbook.Dockerrun.aws.json\n: the file name of the Docker task definition (use the full path of the file if it is not in the same directory as l0-setup)\n\n\nguestbook\n: a name for the deploy, which you will use later when you create the service\n\n\n\n\nThe Deploy Name and Version are combined to create a unique identifier for a deploy.\nIf you create additional deploys named \"guestbook,\"  they will be assigned different version numbers.\n\n\nPart 4: Create the service\n#\n\n\nThe final part of the deployment process involves using the \nservice create\n command to create a new service and associate it with the environment, load balancer and deployment you created in the previous sections. The service will execute the containers described in the deployment. In this example, you will create a new service called \"guestbooksrv\".\n\n\nTo create the service:\n\n\n\n  \nAt the command prompt, run the following command:\n    \n\n      \nl0 service create --loadbalancer demo:guestbooklb demo guestbooksvc guestbook:latest\n\n    \n\n  \nYou will see the following output:\n\nSERVICE ID    SERVICE NAME  ENVIRONMENT  LOADBALANCER  DEPLOYS      SCALE\n1guestbooksvc   guestbooksvc  demo         guestbooklb   guestbook:1  0/1\n\n  \n\n\n\n\nThe following is an summary of the arguments passed in the above command:\n\n\n\n\nservice create\n: creates a new service\n\n\n--loadbalancer demo:guestbooklb\n: the fully-qualified name of the load balancer; in this case, the load balancer named \"guestbooklb\" in the environment named \"demo.\" It is not strictly necessary to use the fully qualified name of the load balancer, unless another load balancer with exactly the same name exists in a different environment.\n\n\ndemo\n: the name of the environment you created in \nPart 1\n\n\nguestbooksvc\n: a name for the service you are creating\n\n\nguestbook\n: the name of the deploy that you created in \nPart 3\n\n\n\n\nCheck the status of the service\n#\n\n\nAfter you create a service, it may take several minutes for that service to completely finish deploying. You can check the status of a service using the \nservice get\n command.\n\n\nTo check the status:\n\n\n\n  \nAt the command prompt, type the following command to check the status of the \"guestbooksvc\" deploy:\n    \n\n      \nl0 service get demo:guestbooksvc\n\n    \n\n\n\n\nInitially, you will see an asterisk (*) next to the name of the \"guestbook:1\" deploy; this indicates that the service is in a transitional state. In this phase, if you execute the \nservice get\n command again, you will see the following output:\n\n\nSERVICE ID    SERVICE NAME  ENVIRONMENT  LOADBALANCER  DEPLOYS       SCALE\n1guestbooksvc   guestbooksvc  demo         guestbooklb   guestbook:1*  0/1\n\n\n\n\nIn the next phase of the deployment, you will see \"(1)\" in the Scale column; this indicates that 1 copy of the service is transitioning to an active state. In this phase, if you execute the \nservice get\n command again, you will see the following output:\n\n\nSERVICE ID    SERVICE NAME  ENVIRONMENT  LOADBALANCER  DEPLOYS      SCALE\n1guestbooksvc   guestbooksvc  demo         guestbooklb   guestbook:1  1/1\n\n\n\n\nGet the application URL\n#\n\n\nOnce the service has been completely deployed, you can obtain the URL for your application and launch it in a browser.\n\n\nTo test your web application:\n\n\n\n  \nAt the command prompt, type the following command:\n    \n\n      \nl0 loadbalancer get demo:guestbooklb\n\n    \n\n  You will see the following output:\n  \nLOADBALANCER ID  LOADBALANCER NAME  ENVIRONMENT  SERVICES            PORTS       PUBLIC  URL\n1guestbooklb     guestbooklb        demo         1guestbooksvc99706  80:80/HTTP  true    \nurl\n\n  \nCopy the value shown in the \nURL\n column and paste it into a web browser. The guestbook application will appear.\n\n\n\n\nCleanup\n#\n\n\nWhen you're finished with the example, instruct Layer0 to delete the environment to terminate the application and the Layer0 the application was using.\n\n\n    \n\n      \nl0 environment delete demo",

The first method is to update the existing Deploy to refer to a new Docker task definition. The second method is to create a new Service that uses the same Loadbalancer. The third method is to create both a new Loadbalancer and a new Service.\n\n\nThere are advantages and disadvantages to each of these methods. The following sections discuss the advantages and disadvantages of using each method, and include procedures for implementing each method.\n\n\nMethod 1: Refer to a new task definition\n#\n\n\nThis method of updating a Layer0 application is the easiest to implement, because you do not need to rescale the Service or modify the Loadbalancer. This method is completely transparent to all other components of the application, and using this method does not involve any downtime.\n\n\nThe disadvantage of using this method is that you cannot perform A/B testing of the old and new services, and you cannot control which traffic goes to the old service and which goes to the new one.\n\n\nTo replace a Deploy to refer to a new task definition:\n\n\n\n\nAt the command line, type the following to create a new Deploy: \nl0 deploy create [pathToTaskDefinition] [deployName]\nNote that if \n[deployName]\n already exists, this step will create a new version of that Deploy.\n\n\nType the following to update the existing Service: \nl0 service update [existingServiceName] [deployName]\nBy default, the Service you specify in this command will refer to the latest version of \n[deployName]\n, if multiple versions of the Deploy exist.\nNote\nIf you want to refer to a specific version of the Deploy, type the following command instead of the one shown above: \nl0 service update [serviceName] [deployName]:[deployVersion]\n\n\n\n\nMethod 2: Create a new Deploy and Service using the same Loadbalancer\n#\n\n\nThis method of updating a Layer0 application is also rather easy to implement. Like the method described in the previous section, this method is completely transparent to all other services and components of the application. This method also you allows you to re-scale the service if necessary, using the \nl0 service scale\n command. Finally, this method allows for indirect A/B testing of the application; you can change the scale of the application, and observe the success and failure rates.\n\n\nThe disadvantage of using this method is that you cannot control the routing of traffic between the old and new versions of the application.\n\n\nTo create a new Deploy and Service:\n\n\n\n\nAt the command line, type the following to create a new Deploy (or a new version of the Deploy, if \n[deployName]\n already exists):\n \nl0 deploy create [pathToTaskDefinition] [deployName]\n\n\nType the following command to create a new Service that refers to \n[deployName]\n behind an existing Loadbalancer named \n[loadbalancerName]\n:\n \nl0 service create --loadbalancer [loadbalancerName] [environmentName] [deployName]\n\n\nCheck to make sure that the new Service is working as expected. If it is, and you do not want to keep the old Service, type the following command to delete the old Service: \nl0 service delete [oldServiceName]\n\n\n\n\nMethod 3: Create a new Deploy, Loadbalancer and Service\n#\n\n\nThe final method of updating a Layer0 service is to create an entirely new Deploy, Loadbalancer and Service. This method gives you complete control over both the new and the old Service, and allows you to perform true A/B testing by routing traffic to individual Services.\n\n\nThe disadvantage of using this method is that you need to implement a method of routing traffic between the new and the old Loadbalancer.\n\n\nTo create a new Deploy, Loadbalancer and Service:\n\n\n\n\nAt the command line, type the following command to create a new Deploy:\nl0 deploy create [pathToTaskDefinition] [deployName]\n\n\nType the following command to create a new Loadbalancer:\n \nl0 loadbalancer create --port [portNumber] [environmentName] [loadbalancerName] [deployName]\nNote\nThe value of \n[loadbalancerName]\n in the above command must be unique.\n\n\nType the following command to create a new Service: \nl0 service create --loadbalancer [loadBalancerName] [environmentName] [serviceName] [deployName]\nNote\nThe value of \n[serviceName]\n in the above command  must be unique.\n\n\nImplement a method of routing traffic between the old and new Services, such as \nHAProxy\n or \nConsul\n.",
