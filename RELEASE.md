# Layer0 Release Process
This document describes the release process for Layer0.

## Release Branching Worklow
Layer0 follows the branching workflow as described by the [Git Flow](http://danielkummer.github.io/git-flow-cheatsheet/) model. This model ensures that the `master` branch is always in a production-ready state.

The basic branching workflow is:
```
<feature branches> -> develop -> release -> master
```

## Pre-release Checklist
Before starting the release process, make sure to check the following items:

* Have all the necessary [merge requests](https://github.com/quintilesims/layer0/merge_requests) been merged?
* Does a [release](https://github.com/quintilesims/layer0/branches) branch already exist? It should have been removed after the last release.
* Do you have the [layer0](https://github.com/quintilesims/layer0) repository cloned locally with a remote named `xfra`? If not, run: 
``` 
git remote add xfra ssh://git@gitlab.imshealth.com:2222/xfra/layer0.git
```

# Release Process
The following section describes the entire workflow for releasing a new Layer0 version.
## Create the `release` branch
Run these commands in the your local `layer0` repository to create the `release` branch:

```
# Checkout latest version of the develop branch
git fetch xfra
git checkout remotes/xfra/develop

# Create the release branch and merge it with master
git checkout -b release
git merge remotes/xfra/master

# Push the release branch to gitlab
git push -u xfra release
```

## Add Release Notes 
Update [RELEASE_NOTES.md](https://github.com/quintilesims/layer0/blob/release/RELEASE_NOTES.md) with information about the current release. 
This can either be done locally or through the [Gitlab UI](https://github.com/quintilesims/layer0/edit/release/RELEASE_NOTES.md). 
Please follow the existing formatting when adding release notes.
Commit your changes and push them to the `release` branch when you are done.

## Update Documentation
There are a couple of references in the [docs](https://github.com/quintilesims/layer0/tree/release/docs/docs) section that will need to be updated with the latest version:

* [mkdocs.yml](https://github.com/quintilesims/layer0/blob/release/docs/mkdocs.yml#L40)
* [index.md](https://github.com/quintilesims/layer0/blob/release/docs/docs/index.md)
* [releases.md](https://github.com/quintilesims/layer0/blob/release/docs/docs/releases.md)

Commit your changes and push them to the release branch when you are done.

## Merge Release into Master
With the release notes and documentation updated, [create a merge request](https://github.com/quintilesims/layer0/merge_requests/new#) from the `release` branch targeting the `master` branch. 
Wait for the unit tests and smoketests to pass before merging. 
Once the merge request has finished, make sure to delete the `release` branch. 

## Add Version Tag
Once the merge request has been merged, add a new version tag:

```
# Fetch the updated master branch
git fetch xfra
git checkout remotes/xfra/master

# Add and push the version tag
git tag -a vX.X.X -m "<some message about the version>"
git push xfra --tag
```

## Build and Push the Layer0 Binaries
To build and release the Layer0 binaries and Docker images, run the following from the `layer0` repo: 
```
git checkout vX.X.X
make release
```
This process will take a couple minutes. 
Once completed, the zipped release files will be located in the [xfra-layer0](https://console.aws.amazon.com/s3/home?region=us-west-2#&bucket=xfra-layer0&prefix=release) S3 bucket. 

# Announce the release
Once the release is available for download, send a message to
[#xfra](https://ims-dev.slack.com/messages/xfra) with a link and a one-line
summary of the release contents. For example:
```
@here Layer0 has released v0.5.2 http://docs.xfra.ims.io/releases - which aims to be a stable version of our load balancer support.
```

# Merge Master into Develop
To bring the `develop` branch up-to-date with `master`, create a [create a merge request](https://github.com/quintilesims/layer0/merge_requests/new#) from the `master` branch targeting the `develop` branch.
